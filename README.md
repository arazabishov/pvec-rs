[![API](https://docs.rs/pvec/badge.svg?version=0.2.1)](https://docs.rs/pvec/0.2.1/pvec/)

A persistent vector implementation based on RRB-Tree for Rust, inspired by the blog post of Niko Matsakis - [In Rust, ordinary vectors are values](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/02/01/in-rust-ordinary-vectors-are-values/). This project offers a general-purpose, persistent vector with good performance across all operations, including efficient clone, concatenation, and splitting.

One of the vector types - **PVec**, explores an idea of starting out as the standard vector and spills to the tree representation only when cloned to offer the best possible performance. The API of methods provided by pvec-rs is identical to the standard vector, reducing the friction of using the library. Another notable feature is the out of the box support for [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon).

The performance evaluation of the library is provided in the [technical report](https://abishov.com/thesis). PVec is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pvec), and API documentation is available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/pvec/0.2.1/pvec/).

## Example

A demonstration of using **PVec**:

```rust
extern crate pvec;

use pvec::PVec;

fn example_pvec(size: usize) {
    let mut vec = PVec::new();
    // ^ backed by the standard vector internally

    for i in 0..size {
        vec.push(i);
    }

    let cln = vec.clone();
    // ^ transitions to RrbVec internally,
    // with consequent clones that cost O(1)

    let res: PVec<usize> = vec.into_par_iter()
        .map(|it| it + 1)
        .collect();
    // ^ processing vector in parallel and
    // collecting results
}
```

## Benchmarks

### Runtime

Runtime benchmarks are subdivided into sequential and parallel groups. The framework used to run benchmark is [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs), which can generate an HTML report with charts if you have gnuplot pre-installed.

```bash
# running all sequential benches
cargo bench

# running parallel benches
cargo bench --features=arc,rayon_iter
```

The report can be found at `target/criterion/report/index.html`. To avoid running benchmarks for hours, pass the `--sample-size=10` option to reduce the sample count.

**Results**
Benchmarks were executed against the library configured with `Arc` and `Rc` pointers. The results are available here: [arc](https://abishov.com/pvec-rs-benchmarks/arc/report/index.html) and [rc](https://abishov.com/pvec-rs-benchmarks/rc/report/index.html).

### Memory

Memory footprint is measured using a custom binary crate - **benches-mem**. This binary runs benchmarks from the **benches** crate through the [time](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=time) util, capturing the peak memory usage of the process. The report is placed at `target/release/report`. Note, these benchmarks can be executed only on macOS at the moment, as `time` behaves differently on mac and linux.

```bash
cd benches-mem && sh bench.sh
```
